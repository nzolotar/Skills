I need you to write the pseudocode for a function that takes in a list of integers and returns them rearranged into a staircase, if possible, or False otherwise. A staircase is a list of lists where list 0 has length 1, and every list i+1 is one item longer than list i. The order of the elements in the staircase doesnâ€™t matter.

Here are some input/output examples that show what I mean:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output: [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Output: False

In the example [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the list of lists only has one element in its fourth list:

[[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]

That is NOT equal to the length of the previous list plus one. The last list would have to have four elements to be a valid staircase.
